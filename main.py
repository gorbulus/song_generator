# Music Prompt Generator
# William Ponton
# 5.8.21
# A program that generates random constraints for creating a piece of music.  
# The constraints will be in place to force the creator to avoid the exquisite misery of choice.
# Sometimes the best music is the most inspired by chance and dancing with the moment.
