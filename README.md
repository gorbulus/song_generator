# Song Generator

A whimsical helper to introduce constraints in the creative process.

Sometime there can be too many choices in the creative process!

## Description
#### Started: May 8th, 2021
#### Completed: May 9th, 2021

A few years ago I made a fun 'randomizer' in C++ that would give me some contraints in the songwriting process.  I was learning OOP for the first time and the project was a fun way to build something useful while learninig more about C++, objects, and classes.

Now that I predominantly write Python, I thought that this would be a fun project to revisit and recreate using some of the data structures native to the language.

## Creative Blocks
Sometimes in the creative process, you can get in a rut where you are stuck with the same old ideas or flavors in your art - it happens!

Other times, you might find that inspiration just isn't striking you, and you feel that you're out of ideas, or just not that artistic anymore.  Don't give up!

I've found that introducing some limitations up front can help limit the options that are available in the creative process, thus forcing you to work with what you have.  The reduced number of creative decisions means that you are able to think outside of the rut and groove within the confines of the limitations - often this leads to some freaky exploration of spaces that you never intended to travel!

Music is about dancing into the moment and letting the emotion flow, so this is a fun way to introduce some 'lane bumpers' to your songwriting up front so you can focus on the rhythm and melody.

## Design
Dictionaries and Objects.  Oh my.
- Goal 1 of this project was to make a fun Song Generator so I could get some quick inspiration for a new doodle when I'm writing.  Another
- Goal 2 of this project was to explore the somewhat esoteric data structures that Python has to offer, namely dictionaries that have lists as values
- Goal 3 of this project was to to integrate those complex data structures into and OOP design to better understand the flexibility of Python classes and methods

## Summary
A fun afternoon of coding, and I have learned a ton about dictionaries and classes in Python.  I'm certainly going to use the sweat equity from this mini-project in my Bookmine project, where I'll need to use some pretty complex data structures to make things work.  In the Bookmine, I expect there will be some nasty nested dictionaries, and nested lists as values, so wish me luck!

### Future plans - TBD
- Move all data to JSON file and parse into dictionary from JSON
- Save results to a text file
- Create a UI form and loop logic
